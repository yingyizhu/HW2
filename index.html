			<p>When I was young, I spent a lot of time clinging to my mother in her company when she was at work. She was an accountant, and her main work, from my little girl's perspective, was filling all kinds of documentations and stamping them with different seals. For me, I found those colourful rectangles and triangles on the forms were sort of beautiful. I often asked my mum what all those mean, but she always told me that I would have time to find out when I was old enough. I therefore kept with such wish for inquiry till I got my enrolment to university, and I chose Accounting as my major particularly. I started to learn many accounting-related courses and get to know more about this subject. </p>

<p>However, what really stimulated my passion for accounting was a speech of Mr. Fudong Wang, one of our professors. He said: "For those of amateurs, accounting is a subject; for those who have been working in this field for a while, accounting is a technique; but for those who truly grasp its essence, accounting is a kind of art." He stated that besides filling forms and stamping seals and other practical matter, accounting is an art about designing and realizing a most favourable financial presentation. It is the word "art" that captures me completely, and I have also discovered the "beauty" of this art. Through learning courses like Basic Accounting, Intermediate Financial Practices, Accounting Practices, I have come to taste such beauty. I believe that the many parts contained in the subject of accounting, such as practices, entry, fiscal statements, budgets and fix assets management, are just like different brushes and colours an artist uses when composing a painting. If an accountant is compatible enough, he or she would be able to create an wonderful "artistic organism" by taking advantage of all those elements; he or she knows which "brush" or "colour " is appropriate to choose, and the "theme" would be perfectly clear. Therefore, my interest in accounting intensifies enormously, and my early hobby has transformed into my future career orientation----I want to become a capable "artist" who could create such admirable work, and I do believe that there are practical reasons for me to make this decision.</p>
